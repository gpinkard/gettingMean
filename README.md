Finished chapter five. In this chapter we worked with Mongo to start building the database. This process was harder than it had to be, I made a mistake
early on, by accident I created two mLab databases using the Heroku plugin. Once I sorted that out it was smooth sailing for the most part. Since this
chapter did not focus on the website, I am not certain whether I did everything correctly, as I had no way of viewing my progress. However I was able to
push the documents from my local database to mLab, so I am fairly certain everything is working as it should. Robomongo proved to be a very useful tool.
Here is a picture of my control panel on mLab:

Chapter Four

Finished chapter four. In this chapter we implemented various screens, and set up the various screens required for the app (reviews, location info, etc.)
The only real issue I had was trivial and quickly remedied: my map was not showing, but this was due to a mistake in indenting in one of the .jade files.
Other than that it went smoothly. The typo occured on page 99. The book used a .js file extension instead of a .jade one. Using this extension would crash
the program. Here is a screenshot of the info page:

Chapter Three

Finished the chapter 3 tutorial. Heroku application is now up and running. The whole process did not go as smooth as I initially thought it was going to be. After getting bootstrap and jQuery installed I tried to launch the app using nodemon. This did not work. After discovering a few errors, remedying them, and finding that my app still did not work, I restarted the project. Same problem. It looked like this:

Finally discovered that I had somehow managed to download the wrong version of bootstrap. After fixing that the app worked perfectly. Then it was just a matter of setting up and pushing it to heroku. Here is a screenshot of it working:
