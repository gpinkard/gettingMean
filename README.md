Finished the chapter 3 tutorial. Heroku application is now up and running. The whole process did not go as smooth as I initially thought it was going to be. After getting bootstrap and jQuery installed I tried to launch the app using nodemon. This did not work. After discovering a few errors, remedying them, and finding that my app still did not work, I restarted the project. Same problem. It looked like this:

Finally discovered that I had somehow managed to download the wrong version of bootstrap. After fixing that the app worked perfectly. Then it was just a matter of setting up and pushing it to heroku. Here is a screenshot of it working:
